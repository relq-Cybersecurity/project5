# Active Directory Security Assessment Report
## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the process of setting up a Windows Server environment with Active Directory (AD), securing its configurations, and conducting penetration testing using industry-standard tools. The purpose is to enhance system administration and security assessment skills.

**Goals:**

Build a fully functioning AD environment

Implement security best practices

Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities

**Tools Used:**

Windows Server

VirtualBox

Kali Linux

CrackMapExec, Mimikatz, BloodHound, Nmap, Enum4linux-ng, Impacket

## 2. Windows Server & Active Directory Setup

**Installation & Configuration**

Installed Windows Server and assigned a static IP

Configured hostname and updated system

Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Promoted server to domain controller (mydomain.local)

**Domain & Organizational Setup**

Configured DNS and created AD forest

Established key Organizational Units (OUs) (e.g., IT, Finance)

Created user accounts (Admin, StandardUser) and security groups

**Security Configuration**

Applied Group Policy settings for access control

Configured password policies and administrative restrictions

## 3. Penetration Testing Process

**Information Gathering**

Used Nmap for network scanning: nmap -A domain_ip

Enum4linux-ng for AD enumeration

**Exploitation**

CrackMapExec to test SMB shares

Mimikatz for credential dumping

Kerberoasting using Impacket (GetUserSPNs.py)

**Lateral Movement & Persistence**

Pass-the-Hash with Mimikatz

WinRM exploitation

Persistence via backdoor accounts & Group Policy manipulation

## 4. Findings & Analysis

Identified misconfigurations and security risks

Documented vulnerabilities and exploited weaknesses

# what is AD

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service used to manage users, computers, and other resources in a network. It organizes these elements using Organizational Units (OUs), Users, and Groups to apply policies, control access, and enhance security.

### Before proceeding
.Must have an administrativ privilege on server

# what is Organizational Units (OUs)

An Organizational Unit (OU) is a container within Active Directory that helps organize users, groups, and computers. OUs allow administrators to manage and apply Group Policies to specific subsets of objects in AD.

**How to create OU, User and Groups on Active Directory**

# Users in Active Directory

A User in AD represents an individual account that can log in and access resources based on assigned permissions.

**Types of Users:**

  **. Domain Users: Regular user accounts created in AD (e.g., employees)**

  **. Administrator Users: Accounts with elevated privileges (e.g., Administrator)**

  **. Service Accounts: Used by applications/services instead of humans**

**Example:**

  **jdoe@mydomain.local (Regular user)**

  **admin@mydomain.local (Administrator user)**


# Groups in Active Directory

A Group is a collection of users that can be managed as a single unit. Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, they are assigned to groups for easier management.

**Types of Groups:**

  **. Security Groups: Used to assign permissions and access control**
  
  **. Distribution Groups: Used for email distribution (not for security)**
  
**Create Group and add users on it**

# What is a Group Policy Object (GPO) in Active Directory?

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a collection of settings that control the configuration and security of computers and users within an Active Directory (AD) domain. It allows administrators to enforce rules and automate management tasks across multiple systems.

# Key Functions of GPOs

✅ Security Enforcement – Control password policies, account lockouts, firewall settings.

✅ System Configuration – Set desktop backgrounds, disable USB access, configure network settings.

✅ Software Deployment – Install, update, or restrict software applications.

✅ User Restrictions – Prevent access to Control Panel, Task Manager, or removable storage.

#  How to Create and Link a Group Policy Object in Active Directory

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is used to enforce security settings, configurations, and restrictions on users and computers within an Active Directory (AD) environment.

**Step 1: Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**

1.Log in to your Windows Server as an administrator.

2.Press ```Win + R```, type ```gpmc.msc```, and press Enter.

  .This will open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).


**Step 2: Create a New GPO**

![im1](https://github.com/Sonakhach/project5/blob/main/img/Screenshot%20from%202025-02-19%2011-31-09.png)


**Step 3: Edit the GPO**

1.Right-click the newly created GPO and select Edit.

2.The Group Policy Management Editor opens.

3.Navigate to the policy settings you want to configure.

  .Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings
  
  .User Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates
  
4.Modify the required settings (e.g., enforce password complexity, disable USB access, set login restrictions).

5.Close the Group Policy Management Editor when done.

**Step 4: Link the GPO to an Organizational Unit (OU)**

![im1](https://github.com/Sonakhach/project5/blob/main/img/Screenshot%20from%202025-02-19%2011-46-51.png)

GPOs can be applied at different levels in Active Directory:

  **Site** – Applies to all computers and users in an AD site.
  
  **Domain** – Affects all users and computers in the domain.
  
  **Organizational Unit (OU)** – Target specific users/computers within an OU.
  
![im1](https://github.com/Sonakhach/project5/blob/main/img/Screenshot%20from%202025-02-19%2011-58-12.png)

**Step 5: Force Group Policy Update (Optional)**

By default, GPOs update automatically, but you can manually force an update:

1.Open Command Prompt on a domain-joined computer.

2.Run:

```
gpupdate /force
```

3.Restart the computer if required.

# Kerberosing with Impacket
## What is Kerberos?
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide secure authentication for users and services over an insecure network. It was developed by MIT and is widely used in enterprise environments, especially in Microsoft Active Directory.

To perform Kerberoasting, tools like Impacket’s GetUserSPNs.py are used to find Service Principal Names (SPNs) linked to service accounts.

![im1](https://github.com/Sonakhach/project5/blob/main/img/Screenshot%20from%202025-02-20%2000-07-59.png)

If there are no SPNs, create one:

```
setspn -A HTTP/testservice.mylab.local mylab\testuser

```
